    " - Return a new dataset formed by selecting those elements of the source on which func returns true. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### flatMap(func) \n",
    " - Similar to map, but each input item can be mapped to 0 or more output items (so func should return a Seq rather than a single item). \n",
    " \n",
    "#### mapPartitions(func)\n",
    " - Similar to map, but runs separately on each partition (block) of the RDD, so func must be of type (Iterator) \n",
    " \n",
    "#### mapPartitionsWithIndex(func)\n",
    " - Similar to mapPartitions, but also provides func with an integer value representing the index of the partition, so func must be of type (Int, Iterator)\n",

    "   - When called on datasets of type (K, V) and (K, W), returns a dataset of (K, (V, W)) pairs with all pairs of elements for each key. Outer joins are supported through leftOuterJoin, rightOuterJoin, and fullOuterJoin. \n",
    "    \n",

    "#### pipe(command, [envVars]) \n",
    " - Pipe each partition of the RDD through a shell command, e.g. a Perl or bash script. RDD elements are written to the process's stdin and lines output to its stdout are returned as an RDD of strings. \n",

    "### Data Serialization\n",
    "- Storing RDD is serialized form, it reduces memory usage.\n",
    "- Spark provides two serialization libraries:\n",
    "    - Java serialization:  Spark serializes objects using Java’s ObjectOutputStream framework  by implementing java.io.Serializable and  java.io.Externalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Kryo serialization: \n",
    "        - Kryo is significantly faster and more compact than Java serialization (often as much as 10x), but does not support all Serializable types and requires you to register the classes you’ll use in the program in advance for best performance.\n",

    "    \n",
    "###  Memory Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "- considerations in tuning memory usage\n",
    "    - Amount of memory used by your objects\n",
    "    - Cost of accessing those objects\n",
    "    - The overhead of garbage collection\n",
    "- we will describe how to determine the memory usage of your objects, and how to improve it – either by changing your data structures, or by storing data in a serialized format. We will then cover tuning Spark’s cache size and the Java garbage collector.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory Management Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Spark, execution and storage share a unified region (M).\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Determining Memory Consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "- To estimate the memory consumption of a particular object, use SizeEstimator’s estimate method \n",
    "\n",
    "####        Tuning Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "- avoid the Java features that add overhead, such as pointer-based data structures and wrapper objects. There are several ways to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -  prefer arrays of objects, and primitive types, instead of the standard Java or Scala collection classes \n",
    "    - avoid nested structures with a lot of small objects and pointers when possible.\n",
    "    - Consider using numeric IDs or enumeration objects instead of strings for keys.\n",
    "    - If you have less than 32 GiB of RAM, set the JVM flag -XX:+UseCompressedOops to make pointers be four bytes instead of eight. You can add these options in spark-env.sh.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "####        Serialized RDD Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "- use the serialized StorageLevels in the RDD persistence API, such as MEMORY_ONLY_SER\n",
    "- downside of storing data in serialized form is slower access times, due to having to deserialize each object on the fly\n",
    "\n",
    "- spark highly recommend using Kryo if you want to cache data in serialized form\n",
    "\n",
    "####        Garbage Collection Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "- The cost of garbage collection is proportional to the number of Java objects, so using data structures with fewer objectsgreatly lowers this cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An even better method is to persist objects in serialized form, as described above: now there will be only one object (a byte array) per RDD partition\n",
    "\n",
    "- first step in GC tuning is to<b>Measuring the Impact</b> i.e. of GC collect statistics on how frequently garbage collection occurs and the amount of time spent GC. This can be done by adding -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps to the Java options\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Level of Parallelism : \n",
    "     -  try setting the level of parallelism for each operation high enough\n",
    "     - config property spark.default.parallelism\n",
    "        \n",
    "- Parallel Listing on Input Paths :\n",
    "    - Sometimes you may also need to increase *directory listing parallelism when job input has large number of directories, otherwise the process could take a very long time, especially when against object store like S3\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "- Broadcasting Large Variables :\n",
    "    - Using the broadcast functionality available in SparkContext can greatly reduce the size of each serialized task, and the cost of launching a job over a cluster\n",
    "        \n",
    "- Data Locality :\n",
    "    - If data and the code that operates on it are together then computation tends to be fast.\n",
    "    - Spark prefers to schedule all tasks at the best locality level,\n",
    "    - Spark typically does is wait a bit in the hopes that a busy CPU frees up. Once that timeout expires, it starts moving the data from far away to the free CPU\n",
    "    - Wait timeout for fallback between each level can be configured individually or all together in one parameter; see the <b>spark.locality</b> parameters on the\n",
